# This table may have duplicate rows.
# This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
# The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
# The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.

# We define query quality as: The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
# We also define poor query percentage as: The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

# Q: Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
# Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
# Return the result table in any order.

# A:
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating * 1.0 / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
WHERE
    query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
